#  Recipe Book Web Application

This project is a web-based application designed to manage and display personal recipes. It allows users to add, view, and search for dishes in a visually appealing and user-friendly format. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application stores all recipe data locally in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across sessions without requiring a backend.

---

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic, responsive recipe book that provides:

- A simple interface to **add recipes** with image, name, ingredients, and preparation steps.
- A **searchable** recipe list with a clean tile view (only image and name).
- A **detailed view** when a user clicks a recipe tile.
- A **persisted experience** using localStorage so the data remains intact even after refreshing or closing the browser.

---

##  Features

###  Add Recipes
- Users can add recipes using a modal form.
- Input fields include:
  - Recipe Name
  - Ingredients (separated by commas)
  - Preparation Steps (multi-line textarea)
  - Upload Photo (styled button)
- Input validation ensures all fields are filled.

###  View Recipes
- Main page shows **only the recipe image and name** in a grid layout.
- Clicking on a recipe tile displays the full details in a scrollable, styled overlay.
- A **"Close" button** brings the user back to the main view smoothly.

###  Search Functionality
- Search bar filters recipes by name or ingredients.
- Responsive search with instant filtering.

###  Data Persistence
- All recipes are stored using **`localStorage`**.
- Recipes persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

###  Design
- The color theme uses warm beige, white, soft blue, and dark gray for a clean and professional look.
- Fully responsive layout across devices.
- Custom styling for the upload photo button.
- Smooth transitions and scroll behavior.

##  How It Works

1. User opens the app and sees a grid of recipes (name + image).
2. Clicking a recipe opens a modal with full details and a "Close" button.
3. "Add Recipe" button opens a form modal to input new recipes.
4. Recipes are stored locally and dynamically rendered to the UI.
5. Search field filters recipes live by name or ingredients.
